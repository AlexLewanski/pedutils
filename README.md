## Overview
The `pedutils` package houses code to work with pedigree information. Currently, most of the content focuses on basic pedigree processing and manipulation. At this stage of the package, it does not have a particularly specialized scope and is primarily serving as a convenient receptacle for developing and documenting code in an intentional way. If you stumble upon this repo and end up working with the `pedutils` package, please let me know if you find errors and/or if there are things you want added or improved. This package is at an incipient stage, so be prepared for fairly substantial changes and additions (including fleshing out of this README).
