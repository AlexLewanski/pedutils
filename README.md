## Overview
The `pedutils` package houses code to manipulate and analyze pedigree information. In its current state, it does not have a particularly specialized scope and is primarily serving as a convenient receptacle for developing and documenting code in an intentional way. If you find your way onto this repo and end up working with the `pedutils` package, please let me know if you find errors and/or if there are things you want added or improved. This package is at its incipient stages, so be prepared for fairly substantial changes and additions (including this README).
